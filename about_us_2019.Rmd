## Load libraries subtitle

You may have to install these first! The first two come from CRAN, the third one comes from Github! 

```{r libraries}
library(googlesheets)
library(pheatmap)
```


# Read in the data

This is the data about us that we just created! 

```{r read_data}
my_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16eC3vwEcEdCC0GUUyJXV_fzCkdMlKaaYBygyx-_j_oQ/edit?usp=sharing"
my_gs = gs_url(my_url)
dat = gs_read(my_gs)
```

# Make the plot

This makes the pretty heatmap that shows what we know!

```{r make_plot}

dat = as.matrix(dat)
dat[is.na(dat)]= 0

pheatmap(dat,
         cluster_rows = FALSE,
         cluster_cols=FALSE)
```
